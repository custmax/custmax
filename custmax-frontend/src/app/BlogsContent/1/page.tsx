                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Why is Digital Marketing Important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Now world is more like a community connected by the Internet. You can acquire knowledge, shop,
                    and work through the Internet. Compared with traditional marketing, e-marketing can enable you to
                    reach a larger customer group and automatically help your enterprise attract customers.
                    If you overlook the importance of digital marketing, it is undoubtedly detrimental to the long-term
                    development of your career. Next, we will introduce four digital marketing strategies for you.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Types of Digital Marketing</h2>

                <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</strong>
                        <p>
                            This is the longest profitable but also the slowest way to achieve results. Through SEO, you
                            can push your website or store to the top of search engines such as Google, which can
                            attract a large number of customers.
                            However, SEO requires technical personnel to operate and plan day after day. Unlike Google
                            Ads, which requires paying for visibility, SEO can generate significant traffic over time
                            without ongoing payments.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><Link href={"/emailMarketing"}>Email Marketing</Link></strong>
                        <p>
                            Email marketing is essential for both beginners and veterans, helping sellers find new
                            customers while maintaining existing ones. Compared to SEO, email marketing is easier to
                            operate because many tools are already available in the market.
                            For example, CusOb can help you achieve the following:
                            <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mt-2">
                                <li>Send automatic welcome emails to subscribers.</li>
                                <li>Automatically send confirmation emails for collaborations.</li>
                                <li>Send newsletters weekly or monthly.</li>
                                <li>Use AI tools to optimize your content.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Social Media Marketing</strong>
                        <p>
                            Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have a significant global influence. Your
                            posts can reach a large audience, but itâ€™s essential to choose the right platform for your
                            business type.
                            For B2B companies, LinkedIn may be more suitable than Facebook. You can also operate
                            multiple platforms simultaneously.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Content Marketing</strong>
                        <p>
                            Consumers often search for relevant knowledge before making purchases. High-quality articles
                            can attract customers effectively, making content marketing a powerful strategy for
                            businesses.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Marketing Strategy of Properly Using Those Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    Each of the above methods has its advantages and disadvantages. We do not recommend relying solely
                    on one method. Obtaining customer support is not just one aspect; it involves developing new
                    customers and maintaining existing ones.
                    Therefore, when implementing your digital marketing strategy, we recommend adopting multiple
                    strategies simultaneously.
                </p>

                    Finally, I hope this digital marketing guide for beginners can help anyone who is striving to start
                    a business.
